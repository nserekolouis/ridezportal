<h1>Introduction, Contractual Relationship</h1>
<p>Thank you for using Ridez/Mywworld.com, services. This terms and conditions of use (the &ldquo;TCU&rdquo;) is a legally binding agreement made by and between MyWorld Corp.Limited (&ldquo;MyWorld&rdquo;), of accessing of the applications, websites, content, products, and services (the "Services," as more more defined herein) made available e territories and possessions by company&rsquo;s and all its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors, and you, acting in your capacity as an individual and/or person, if applicable, on your own or on behalf of the entity, you are legally representing or for whom you are using this website (collectively, &ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;your&rdquo;, &ldquo;yours&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I understand that Ridez/Mywworld.com and any of its affiliates reserves the right to limit or discontinue my use of the online services if I do not abide by these terms and conditions, and all at the sole discretion of Ridez/MyWorld Corp. Ltd.</p>
<p>These terms and conditions apply to MyWorld interactions with you and the MyWorld Services and products as well as others of MyWorld that have this statement embedded. The terms as used by MyWorld in these terms and conditions and in the specific services policy statements as may be derived or referred to for any relevant third parties where applicable is and will be taken as understood and construed generally and universally and where applicable as judiciously noticed to mean, and as conveying certain information and terms from locality to locality. By accessing or using the Services, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you.</p>
<p>Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, program, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in separate region-specific disclosures as may deemed appropriate and shall be additional and complementary to these Terms and in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable&nbsp;Services, the supplementary terms shall prevail.</p>
<h1>Arbitration Agreement</h1>
<p>By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Ridez/MyWorld on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Ridez/MyWorld, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Ridez/MyWorld by someone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>You and Ridez/MyWorld agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Ridez/MyWorld, and not in a court of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where you allege claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration. Ridez/MyWorld agrees to honor your election of forum with respect to your individual sexual assault or sexual harassment claim but in so doing does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the waivers provided in the following paragraph, which will continue to apply in court and arbitration), controversy, claim or&nbsp;dispute.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that you and Ridez/MyWorld are each waiving the right to a trial in court of law or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both you and Ridez/MyWorld otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and Ridez/MyWorld each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property&nbsp;rights.</p>
<p>The process of arbitration adopted will be in accordance with the arbitration rules of the country where you reside. The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the country of residence and will be selected by the parties from the listed dispute arbitrators. Unless you and Ridez/MyWorld otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.</p>

In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Charges you incur will be owed to the Third Party Provider.
